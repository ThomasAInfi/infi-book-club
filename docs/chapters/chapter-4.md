# Chapter 4: Pixar Planning

## Recap: what is pixar planning?

- example: Guggenheim Bilbao vs Sidney Opera house
- long prep time
- starts with a rough outline (12 pages, where are we, whats going on, what happens in the story)
- the outline is reviewed by peers in the company and iterated on
- when they feel it is good they start writing a script
- 120 pages first draft
- this is also iterated over in the same way
- then the whole script is put into storyboards and photographed. This is peer reviewed.
- more iteration: rewrite the script and redo the storyboards.
- repeat 6 to 8 times (typically)
- only then start production

## Key takeaways: 4 reasons why iteration works

- Allows for creativity and experimentation. You are not required to get it right the first time.
- Everything is tested before delivery. Unknowns and challenges are figured out before the project goes over budget and behind schedule. Examples in software: Vaporware and Theranos.
- corrects for "illusion of explanatory depth"
- planning is cheap.

## The lean startup model

- The lean startup model might seem to contradict pixar planning but it does not
- In the lean model we make an MVP, learn what the users think and iterate.
- The method of testing is different (in house vs in "prod") but the idea is the same

## Discussion:

**Is pixar planning appliccable in software development?**

**Is doing "Agile" already the same as Pixar planning?** - how often does a product in production substantially iterate and change?

**At Infi we often require the customer to bring in a PO and a plan. Should Infi encourage experimentation more before implementation?**

**How could we implement iteration when developing?**

    Some ideas:
        Frontend:
            - designs
            - wireframes
            - build some basic user flows without actual implementation
            - Do peer review of designs and user flows
            - iterate


        Backend:
            - infra schematics
            - pseudo code
